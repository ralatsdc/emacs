==========

The following path is added in .bash_profile, .emacs, and .pylintrc:

+ "~/Projects/Blue-Peninsula/bp-content/local/lib/python2.7"

Locally installed packages create entries in the easy_install.pth
file, which can be copied to the corresponding file in

+ /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages
+ /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages

so that pylint reports that the imports are valid.
